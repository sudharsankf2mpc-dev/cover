        This book <span class="highlight">"Operating System"</span> An operating system (OS) is the main software that controls a computer and helps all other programs run. It manages the computer’s memory, files, hardware devices, and allows users to interact with the machine. The OS makes sure each program gets enough resources and keeps everything working smoothly. Examples of operating systems are Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS. Without an operating system, a computer cannot function properly.
